The ###### stood ###### near the riverbank.
I saw a ###### pulling a cart in the village.
Stop ###### like a ######, please be serious!
That old ###### is surprisingly fast.
The farmer owns a ######, two goats, and a cow.
My little brother laughs every time he hears the word ######.
You called me a ######, and Iâ€™m not happy about it.
A ###### is stronger than it looks.
the children rode the ###### up the hill.
He keeps ###### the word ###### in class.
